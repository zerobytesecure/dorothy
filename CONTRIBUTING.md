# Contributing to Dorothy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dorothy! Please read these contribution guidelines carefully so that you spend less time working on GitHub issues and pull requests and can be more productive while contributing to this project.

These guidelines will also help you open meaningful issues that will be more easily understood, considered, and resolved. These guidelines are here to help you whether you are requesting or submitting code for a new feature, reporting a bug, or asking a question.

## Join the Elastic Community Slack workspace

Want to ask a question or discuss an idea without opening a GitHub issue? Feel free to reach out in the **#security** channel in the Elastic Community [Slack workspace](https://ela.st/slack).

## Effective issue creation

Please create an issue in GitHub before committing any code or opening a pull request. This encourages discussion before you spend your valuable time writing code. Nobody wants to receive feedback in a pull request that says "start over" or "closing: won't merge". Let's avoid these situations by having a discussion early on in the development process.

Choose the appropriate issue template when creating an issue.

* **Bug Report**: Report a bug and provide information to help fix it
* **Feature Request**: Request a new feature for this project
* **Question**: Reach out on [Slack](https://ela.st/slack) or open an issue if you prefer asynchronous communication

When opening an issue, please provide as much detail as possible and remember to redact any PII or confidential information from any log snippets or terminal output.

## How we use Git and GitHub

### Branching

* All changes for the next release of Dorothy are made to the `main` branch

### Commit messages

* Feel free to make as many commits as you want, while working on a branch
* Please use your commit messages to include helpful information on your changes. Commit messages like `update` are unhelpful to reviewers. Try to be clear and concise when summarizing a commit. For example: `Add support to search for users by their lastname`. Here's a [good blog](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on general best practices for commit messages

### What goes into a pull request

* Please include an explanation of your changes in your PR description
* Links to relevant issues, external resources, or related PRs are very important and useful
* Where possible, explain what problem is being solved by the PR
* See [Submitting a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request) for more info

## Submitting a pull request

Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and submit a pull request. In the pull request, describe what your changes do and mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place. E.g. "Closes #123".

Always submit your pull against `main` . See [Branching](#branching) for our branching strategy.

### What to expect from a code review

After an issue and pull request is opened, it will be reviewed by Dorothy's code owners. Feedback and suggestions from members of the community are welcome.
